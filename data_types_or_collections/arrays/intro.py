#arrays consists of elements belonging to the same data type-homogenous data type
#the array module needs to be explicitly imported inorder for it's declaration
#can handle direct arithmetic operations
#preferrable for long sequence of data
#specialty of python collections:
#Array: collection of homogenous data - an array is used to assign multiple values to a single variable since
#one variable can only be assigned one value so to overcome this an array is created where u can assign multiple
#values of the same data type.
#drawbacks of array is that: heterogenous data is not supported,#size is fixed - meaning once the value to assign
#inside an array  no new extra value can be assigned

#theory
#file is used to store data
#mainly there are 3 types of operations
#1.Read : to read data from a file - symbol used to read is 'r'
#2.Write : to write a data unto a file - represented using 'w' symbol
#3.Append : to update a file - symbol used to update is 'a'
#create a file reference regardless of any operations

#syntax for creating a file reference:
#variablename=open('argument1','argument2')
#here argument 1 is the path/location of the file that we're trying to perform an operation
#argument 2 is the mode of operation to be performed - that is pass: 'r', 'w', 'a'
#both the arguments are passed within quotes

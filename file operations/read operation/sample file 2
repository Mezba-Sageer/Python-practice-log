The increasing human-tiger conflicts in India have prompted the Union Environment Ministry to initiate
a pilot scheme aimed at managing these challenges. This scheme seeks to enhance monitoring and protection
of tigers outside designated tiger reserves. The National Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and
Planning Authority (CAMPA) has approved funding for this initiative,
which will focus on 80 forest divisions across ten states.
Background of the Scheme
The pilot scheme was approved by CAMPA’s executive committee.
It aims to address the recurring human-tiger conflicts by implementing technical interventions.
The initiative was discussed during the National Board for Wildlife meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The proposed funding for the scheme is ₹88 crore, set to run until 2026-27.

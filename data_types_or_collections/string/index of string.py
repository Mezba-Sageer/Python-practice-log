print(x[0])

print(x[0:6]) #n+1 value is to be given as range bcz works similar to for loop
print(x[2:8]) #space has an index value
print(x[-11:-1]) #negative indexing eg: -11 is should be given first instead of -1
print(x[0:12:2]) #slicing statement - in which the output gives 2 index skipped value
                #2- is the step value like increment value

print(x[7:9])
y="hello"
print(len(y)) #len- function prints the length of the character

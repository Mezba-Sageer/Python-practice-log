#sum of 2 numbers

num1=int(input("enter number 1"))
num2=int(input("enter number 2"))

num3=num1+num2
print(num3)


#when asking for input from the user add int before input in order to read as numerical/integer value
# otherwise it is read as string


#assign the result into a new variable rather than doin it in the print statement
